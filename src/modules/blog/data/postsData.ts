    content: `# On-Device Agents: Privacy-First AI on Your Phone

With the rise of powerful mobile processors and specialized neural processing units (NPUs), on-device AI agents have become a reality. This article explores the technical challenges and solutions for running AI models directly on mobile devices.

## The Promise of On-Device AI

- **Reduced Latency**: No network round trips mean faster response times
- **Enhanced Privacy**: Sensitive data never leaves the device
- **Offline Capabilities**: Functionality without internet connectivity

## Technical Implementation

We'll dive into the architecture of our on-device agent, including model optimization techniques like quantization and pruning to ensure smooth performance on mobile hardware.

## Future Directions

As hardware continues to improve, we expect to see even more sophisticated AI capabilities running directly on devices, opening up new possibilities for privacy-preserving applications.`,

      "Everyone implements RAG; not everyone ships low-latency, high-recall search. We compare multi-vector stores, hybrid sparse+dense retrieval, chunking that preserves discourse, query planning with toolformer prompts, and guardrails that reduce hallucinations.",
    content: `# RAG in 2025: Architectures That Actually Scale

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has evolved significantly since its inception. In this post, we explore the latest architectures that deliver production-grade performance.

## Key Components

- **Multi-Vector Stores**: Leveraging specialized indices for different data types
- **Hybrid Search**: Combining sparse and dense retrieval methods
- **Query Planning**: Dynamic routing for complex information needs

## Implementation Tips

We'll walk through a reference architecture that balances latency and recall, with practical examples in Python and TypeScript.`,

Next.js 15 introduces powerful new features for building AI applications. In this post, we'll explore how to leverage Server Actions for AI feature integration.

## Key Features

- **Streaming Responses**: Deliver AI-generated content as it's being generated
- **Edge Functions**: Run AI models at the edge for reduced latency
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety with TypeScript

## Getting Started

We'll walk through building a simple AI-powered feature using Next.js 15's new capabilities.`,
